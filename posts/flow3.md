This week was exciting as well as there were a lot of super visible changes! We really started to bring things together. Screenshot below:

## Design Overhaul

My responsibility this week was to make the home page look closer to the Flow way that we intented as opposed to just "acceptable." This involved a better fleshed-out recent tabs widget, better background, expanding tabs, fonts, placement, and more styling.

The background underwent two major changes: Unsplash and better linear gradient. Instead of washing out the image with white as to see our text, I darkened the image with our signature dark blue, and changed our test to be a lighter blue. Across all of this we maintain the same HSL color with only lightness changing.

Unsplash allowed us to have an ever-changing interesting background image. This works through an API service that Dean implemented.

## About Us Page

Andrew worked on the About page. It's still mostly a work-in-progress, but so far it looks very close to our original ideas. I can't wait to see how we expand on it.
