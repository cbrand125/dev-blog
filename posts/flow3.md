This week was exciting as well as there were a lot of super visible changes! We really started to bring things together. Screenshot below:

## Design Overhaul

My responsibility this week was to make the home page look closer to the Flow way that we intented as opposed to just "acceptable." This involved a better fleshed-out recent tabs widget, better background, expanding tabs, fonts, placement, and more styling.

The background underwent two major changes: Unsplash and better linear gradient. Instead of washing out the image with white as to see our text, I darkened the image with our signature dark blue, and changed our test to be a lighter blue. Across all of this we maintain the same HSL color with only lightness changing. Using these tricks, I think we managed a LOT more cohesive page. There's more work to be done, especially after the feedback we received, but it's exciting to see the site evolve to where we want it visually!

Unsplash allowed us to have an ever-changing interesting background image. This works through an API service that Dean implemented. It's a little slow now, so we're brainstorming ways to make it faster or more imperceptible to a user.

## About Us Page

Andre worked on the About page. It's still mostly a work-in-progress, but so far it looks very close to our original ideas in terms of formatting. I'm scrummaster for the upcoming week, and so I'll likely take time to help him flesh it out more and move him to a completely different task for the opportunity to learn.

We are using modals heavily in this page, and it's proving to be a little difficult, but once it's figured out we'll all be better for it.
